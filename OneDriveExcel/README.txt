Hello! This is Guilherme Yuji Endo

These Python scripts were made by me for automating HTML pages for ebay use, it uses Microsoft's OneDrive
to fetch pictures inside a "Ebay Pictures" folder in your root directory by inputing an item SKU.

The "ExceltoHTML" script is just the excel file information into a html without pictures, the "onedrive" is just test script to link onedrive's API, and the ODEXCELHTML is the junction of both.

You can also save the .html in your device for other uses, but the real function was to copy and paste the HTML code so we could automate the Ebay pages.

If there is no Ebay Pictures folder in your root nor the excel file with the information, the app won't run.

I also included in the folder an excel file and an folder with products just for test running.

Thank you for your time!
